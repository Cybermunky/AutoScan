*** Must Run As SUDO ***

-AutoScan.sh-
sudo ./AutoScan.sh 10.10.10.10

-Description-
Really basic BASH script that will run 3 different NMAP Scans that I commonly use for CTF-based Engagements & OSCP Prep. This will also detect if Port 80 is available
and will then run a basic DIRB Scan. I plan on adding more functionality over time. - CyberMunky
